2024-06-07 15:16:10,"$SPY$SPX$QQQSmart money is smart for a reason. They do the opposite of retail bc funds are AI enabled and  data driven.  
 
When 51 actively managed funds bought into cannabis sector in Q1, retail was ignoring it.  
 
When funds recently sold large caps and tech at 2008 levels, it was the most crowded retail trade. Same goes for legend Stand Druckenmiller selling entire$NVDAstake and buying small value (already gave ex of Leon Cooperman big in cannabis and in a small edu co ASPU).  
 
Unfolding data like jobs numbers means ridiculous astronomical large cap earnings expectations have to be STEEPLY revised much lower. And indices will take a dive.  
 
All this shows funds were fleeing large caps and tech for good reason.  
 
More data will come to light that will be major negatives for large caps..",0.1298558897243107,0.6597
